## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Key Design Patterns
- **Shared Schema**: Database models and validation schemas shared between client/server using Zod
- **Component Composition**: Reusable UI components with clear separation of concerns
- **API Abstraction**: Centralized API client with standardized error handling
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach using Tailwind CSS breakpoints

### Authentication System

- **Books**: Complete metadata, cover images, user associations
- **Scanning Queue**: Background processing for offline scans with retry logic
- **Sessions**: Secure session storage with automatic cleanup

### 3D Visualization Engine
- **Dynamic Layout**: O(n) TypeScript positioning algorithm with justified rows
- **Physical Scaling**: Authentic book proportions using Amazon dimension data
- **Deterministic Positioning**: Halton sequences for organic, consistent placement
- **Visual Effects**: Paper texture, shadows, and micro-misalignment for realism

## üîß Development
