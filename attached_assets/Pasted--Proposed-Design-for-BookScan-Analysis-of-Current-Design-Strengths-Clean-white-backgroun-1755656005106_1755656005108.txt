# Proposed Design for BookScan

## Analysis of Current Design

### Strengths
- Clean white background with strong typography.
- Simple stats (total books, read, reading) are easy to scan.
- Book covers stand out visually.
- Pop-up modal gives full book detail without leaving the main page.

### Weaknesses
- The **“Unknown Author”** label feels unfinished — metadata should feel polished.
- Cards (“Want to Read” buttons) are visually heavy and duplicated inside details.
- Too much empty white space between sections, creating visual gaps rather than flow.
- The stats (total books, read, reading) look more like *admin boxes* than an inviting part of your reading journey.
- The detail modal is informative but not visually inspiring — it feels like a form rather than a showcase of the book.

## Proposed Design: Clean, Simple & Compelling

### 1. Dashboard Layout
- Replace the three separate stat boxes with a **single horizontal tracker bar** at the top:
  - Example:  
    **📚 2 books** · **✅ 0 read** · **📖 0 reading**
- Smaller, lighter typography with icons for quick recognition.
- Keeps focus on the books themselves.

### 2. Book Grid
- Switch to a **tight, elegant grid** of book covers, with covers as the hero.
- Show only the cover + a subtle overlay (status indicator).
- Example: bottom-right corner has a small tag: *Want to Read / Reading / Finished*.
- Remove redundant text under each cover; reveal details on hover/click.

### 3. Book Detail View
- Make the book detail modal **feel like a showcase**:
  - Full-bleed book cover left side.
  - Right side: clean stacked info with hierarchy:
    - Title (big, bold)
    - Author(s) (always resolved; if unknown, grey placeholder “Author unknown”)
    - ⭐ rating (larger, spaced out)
    - Toggleable reading status (pill-shaped segmented control: Want → Reading → Read).
  - Publication details in collapsible sections (“More Info”).

### 4. Typography & Icons
- Use **lightweight sans-serif typography** with varied sizes for hierarchy.
- Softer iconography (line icons instead of filled).
- Muted but modern colour palette:
  - Blue = reading  
  - Green = finished  
  - Grey = want to read  

### 5. Interactions
- **Hover effect on book covers**: subtle lift + shadow.
- **One-click status toggle**: click the status tag directly on the cover to cycle through *Want → Reading → Read*.
- **Search/filter bar** always visible in top-right, slimmer and integrated.

### 6. Streamlined Experience
- When scanning books, users should see only:
  - The cover (visual memory anchor).
  - The current status (small tag).
- All deeper metadata (ISBN, publication details, ratings) hidden until expanded.
- Reduces noise and keeps the library *visual first, metadata second*.

## The Resulting Feel
- **Slick**: minimal cards, no duplicated metadata.
- **Compelling**: covers dominate, making the library look like a real bookshelf.
- **Streamlined**: fast toggling of reading states, smooth hover animations.
- **Attractive**: consistent typography, subtle colours, elegant modal.

👉 In short: *shift from “admin dashboard of books” to “personal bookshelf you want to browse.”*
