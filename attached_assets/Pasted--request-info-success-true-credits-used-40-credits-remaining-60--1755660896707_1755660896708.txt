    "book_description": "NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER From the former prime minister of New Zealand, then the world’s youngest female head of government and just the second to give birth in office, comes a deeply personal memoir chronicling her extraordinary rise and offering inspiration to a new generation of leaders.“A clear and compelling case for compassion . . . an implicit repudiation of the strongman style of leadership that has taken hold around the world.”—The Washington PostWhat if we could redefine leadership? What if kindness came first? Jacinda Ardern grew up the daughter of a police officer in small-town New Zealand, but as the 40th Prime Minister of her country, she commanded global respect for her empathetic leadership that put people first. This is the remarkable story of how a Mormon girl plagued by self-doubt made political history and changed our assumptions of what a global leader can be.When Jacinda Ardern became Prime Minister at age thirty-seven, the world took notice. But it was her compassionate yet powerful response to the 2019 Christchurch mosque attacks, resulting in swift and sweeping gun control laws, that demonstrated her remarkable leadership. She guided her country through unprecedented challenges—a volcanic eruption, a major biosecurity breach, and a global pandemic—while advancing visionary new policies to address climate change, reduce child poverty, and secure historic international trade deals. She did all this while juggling first-time motherhood in the public eye.Ardern exemplifies a new kind of leadership—proving that leaders can be caring, empathetic, and effective. She has become a global icon, and now she is ready to share her story, from the struggles to the surprises, including for the first time the full details of her decision to step down during her sixth year as Prime Minister.Through her personal experiences and reflections, Jacinda is a model for anyone who has ever doubted themselves, or has aspired to lead with compassion, conviction, and courage. A Different Kind of Power is more than a political memoir; it’s an insight into how it feels to lead, ultimately asking: What if you, too, are capable of more than you ever imagined?",

        "body": "I absolutely loved A Different Kind of Power. Jacinda Ardern has long been a role model for me, not just as a woman in leadership, but as someone who has consistently led with empathy, strength, and a deep sense of responsibility to others. Reading this book felt like being invited into her inner world: her doubts, values, moments of quiet determination, and the relationships that shaped her path.  As a researcher who analyzed Ardern’s pandemic response in my own work, I found it especially moving to read about her perspective from the inside. What I had studied as a policy model took on new life through her reflections, the emotional weight of decision-making, the care for her country, and the burden of leadership during an unprecedented crisis.  But this memoir is not just about politics or crisis management. It is about a different kind of leadership, one rooted in kindness, inclusion, and a clear moral compass. Ardern’s voice throughout is thoughtful and genuine, never self-congratulatory, and often surprisingly humble.  This book reminded me why representation matters, and why we need more leaders like Jacinda Ardern, leaders who don’t see vulnerability as weakness, and who remind us that compassion and competence can absolutely go hand in hand.  A beautiful, honest, and inspiring read. I closed the last page feeling not only admiration, but hope. Read more",

        "body": "It seems improbable that an insecure daughter of a police chief should grow up and become one of the youngest Prime Ministers in New Zealand's history. Equally improbable is that she should accomplish several great things, and thereby command world-wide respect for her bold and empathetic leadership.  Improbable, yes, but it's true.  This is the miraculous story of Jacinda Ardern, a middle class, Mormon girl, who, despite self-doubts, defied the odds and become the leader of her Island nation, as only the third woman to serve as Prime Minister of New Zealand. In office, she would face a multitude of challenges, that a lesser leader might shrink from.  Among her accomplishments was her strong and compassionate response to the 2019 Christchurch mosque attacks, resulting in swift gun-control reforms. She also guided her nation through several unprecedented crises--a volcanic eruption, a major biosecurity breach, and a global pandemic. This, coupled with new policies to address climate change, reduce child poverty, and secure historic international trade deals garnered her world-wide attention and respect. She did this by working impossibly long hours, and juggling first-time motherhood in the public eye.  Jacinda Arden was raised in the middle class town of Murupara, New Zealand, the second of the two daughters of Ross and Laurelli Arden. From the early age of four, young Jacinda showed an unusual interest in politics, and of making a difference in the world. It was these qualities that stayed with her, while advancing through early childhood, of working on her parent's farm, and through her teens working for a local fast-food restaurant. As a Mormon, she learned how to meet and greet the public while canvassing local neighborhoods. Despite her self-doubt, she proved to be hard-working and forever interested in national politics. While attending the University of Waikato, she took a semester abroad at Arizona State University in 2001. After graduating, she spent time in New York City, where she volunteered to work at a soup kitchen, and joined a workers' rights campaign. In 2006, Ardern moved to London, where she became a senior policy advisor in an 80-person policy unit of the United Kingdom Cabinet Office under prime minister Tony Blair. While she didn't meet Blair, she did meet Queen Elizabeth, whom she had always admired, and the two became friends.  Having returned home, she began volunteering as an aid for a local minister of Parliament named Phil Goff, who was a member of the Labor Party (a progressive political group that Jacinda strongly supported). It was Goff who introduced her to \"the Beehive\", an office building in Wellington (the nation's capital), where New Zealand ministers kept their offices.  It wasn't long and Jacinda was meeting with national political leaders of both parties, from the Prime Minister on down. By this time she had left her Mormon faith (because she supported gay rights, while the Mormons did not), and was putting in long hours doing research for Phil, writing position papers, and eventually serving as his speech writer, something at which she excelled (note: her Bachelor of Art's degree was in Communication Studies in Politics and in public relations). Not yet 21, Jacinda was becoming well-known in New Zealand politics, while putting in 12-14 hour days, and loving it.  She would be promoted within her party and move up the party ladder to the point where she would be reporting to Helen Clark, Prime Minister, and leader of the Labor Party.  Ardern's next move was to run for office. In 2017, she was unanimously elected as deputy leader of the Labour Party. which would lead her to serve as a minister in the New Zealand Parliament. Five months later, with an election due, Labour's leader Andrew Little resigned after a historically low opinion poll results for the party. Ardern was elected unopposed to take his place.  Labour's support increased rapidly under Ardern's leadership, and she led her party to gain 14 seats in the 2017 general election, winning 46 seats to the National Party's 56. After negotiations, New Zealand First chose to enter a minority government with Labour, supported by the Green Party, with Ardern as prime minister. On 28 October 2017, she was sworn in by the governor-general, to become at age 37, the world's youngest woman head of state.  One year into office, the Ardern Government made teaching of New Zealand history compulsory. Writes Ardern: \"This was, and remains, one of the policies of which I am most proud. It was about our past, to help us better understand our present. . . .\"  Having spent several years attempting to become pregnant, while running for office, she discovered she was at last pregnant, and would give birth to her daughter (Neve) on 21 June 2018. It would make her the world's second elected head of government to give birth while in office (after Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan). The father was her long-time boyfriend and soul mate, Clarke Gaylord. Gaylord led a career of his own, as a television host. The two would marry, in 2024.  Ardern's Labour Government faced challenges from New Zealand's housing crisis, child poverty, and social inequality. In March 2019, in the aftermath of the Christchurch mosque shootings, Ardern reacted by rapidly introducing strict gun laws. Throughout 2020 she led New Zealand's response to the COVID-19 pandemic, for which she won praise for New Zealand being one of the few Western nations to successfully contain the virus.  Ardern moved the Labour Party further to the political center, as the October 2020 general elections neared, promising to cut spending during the remainder of the COVID-19 recession. She led the Labour Park to a landslide victory, gaining an overall majority of 65 seats in Parliament, the first time a majority government had been formed since 1996.  Writes Ardern: \"Now, for the first time in New Zealand history, the Parliament was 50 percent women. . . . I had been the 99th woman to enter Parliament. Just fourteen years later, the number reached 177. Changes were happening everywhere. Liz Truss had also become prime minister in the U.K. replacing Boris Johnson.  It wasn't long after this that Ardern received word Queen Elizabeth had died, having served her country 70 years. Ardern was quite saddened by the news. She writes \"I was thinking about all the interactions I'd been lucky enough to have had with Her Majesty. The time she'd called during COVID, just to check in. Her stoicism when I'd reached out to express our nation's sadness at the loss of her husband and life companion. Mostly, though, I remembered her extraordinary and unrelenting public life of service while still being a mother and grandmother. 'You just get on with it,' she said\"  Ironically, Jacinda Ardern began to doubt the viability of her leadership--despite her Labour Party's many successes. There was growing doubt about New Zealand's government, and social unrest that manifested itself in a hostile gathering around the Parliament Building, that would last several weeks. At one point Jacinda saw a gallows in their midst, complete with noose, which people told her had been erected for her. She also saw people wearing tin foil to cover their heads, to protect them from electronic waves that were suspected of infilterating their brains with government misinformation.  Also, for the first time, people would confront her in public, telling her she was the world's worst leader. Coupled with the news she might have breast cancer, and the fact she was spending so much time working late in ter office, that she now felt she was not spending enough time with her daughter. That and the fact she was feeling the strain of working too many hours running the country, she decided to resign from office.  Today, she and her family live in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where she is a senior fellow at Harvard University,  While I'm disappointed with her decision to resign from office, I respect her hard work, empathy, and dedication to advance social gains in her native country. Jacinda Ardern is one of the few world leaders who really cares about the people's welfare.  Despite her resignation from office, I enjoyed reading Ms Ardern's autobiography. She's an optimist and a fighter, who made wondrous advances for her country (even if not always appreciated). She's also a gifted writer and born story teller, who invites us to share her life story. Her daughter Neve (rhymes with steve) comes alive in these pages and is adorably human. So, too, is her husband, as well as her parents, grandparents, and political colleagues. You will come to know and admire them all. No small accomplishment.  Bottom line: Jacinda Ardern is a humane voice from Down Under. Read more",

Ardern was elected unopposed to take his place.<br/><br/>Labour&apos;s support increased rapidly under Ardern&apos;s leadership, and she led her party to gain 14 seats in the 2017 general election, winning 46 seats to the National Party&apos;s 56. After negotiations, New Zealand First chose to enter a minority government with Labour, supported by the Green Party, with Ardern as prime minister. On 28 October 2017, she was sworn in by the governor-general, to become at age 37, the world&apos;s youngest woman head of state.<br/><br/>One year into office, the Ardern Government made teaching of New Zealand history compulsory. Writes Ardern: &quot;This was, and remains, one of the policies of which I am most proud. It was about our past, to help us better understand our present. . . .&quot;<br/><br/>Having spent several years attempting to become pregnant, while running for office, she discovered she was at last pregnant, and would give birth to her daughter (Neve) on 21 June 2018. It would make her the world&apos;s second elected head of government to give birth while in office (after Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan). The father was her long-time boyfriend and soul mate, Clarke Gaylord. Gaylord led a career of his own, as a television host. The two would marry, in 2024.<br/><br/>Ardern&apos;s Labour Government faced challenges from New Zealand&apos;s housing crisis, child poverty, and social inequality. In March 2019, in the aftermath of the Christchurch mosque shootings, Ardern reacted by rapidly introducing strict gun laws. Throughout 2020 she led New Zealand&apos;s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, for which she won praise for New Zealand being one of the few Western nations to successfully contain the virus.<br/><br/>Ardern moved the Labour Party further to the political center, as the October 2020 general elections neared, promising to cut spending during the remainder of the COVID-19 recession. She led the Labour Park to a landslide victory, gaining an overall majority of 65 seats in Parliament, the first time a majority government had been formed since 1996.<br/><br/>Writes Ardern: &quot;Now, for the first time in New Zealand history, the Parliament was 50 percent women. . . . I had been the 99th woman to enter Parliament. Just fourteen years later, the number reached 177. Changes were happening everywhere. Liz Truss had also become prime minister in the U.K. replacing Boris Johnson.<br/><br/>It wasn&apos;t long after this that Ardern received word Queen Elizabeth had died, having served her country 70 years. Ardern was quite saddened by the news. She writes &quot;I was thinking about all the interactions I&apos;d been lucky enough to have had with Her Majesty. The time she&apos;d called during COVID, just to check in. Her stoicism when I&apos;d reached out to express our nation&apos;s sadness at the loss of her husband and life companion. Mostly, though, I remembered her extraordinary and unrelenting public life of service while still being a mother and grandmother. &apos;You just get on with it,&apos; she said&quot;<br/><br/>Ironically, Jacinda Ardern began to doubt the viability of her leadership--despite her Labour Party&apos;s many successes. There was growing doubt about New Zealand&apos;s government, and social unrest that manifested itself in a hostile gathering around the Parliament Building, that would last several weeks. At one point Jacinda saw a gallows in their midst, complete with noose, which people told her had been erected for her. She also saw people wearing tin foil to cover their heads, to protect them from electronic waves that were suspected of infilterating their brains with government misinformation.<br/><br/>Also, for the first time, people would confront her in public, telling her she was the world&apos;s worst leader. Coupled with the news she might have breast cancer, and the fact she was spending so much time working late in ter office, that she now felt she was not spending enough time with her daughter. That and the fact she was feeling the strain of working too many hours running the country, she decided to resign from office.<br/><br/>Today, she and her family live in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where she is a senior fellow at Harvard University,<br/><br/>While I&apos;m disappointed with her decision to resign from office, I respect her hard work, empathy, and dedication to advance social gains in her native country. Jacinda Ardern is one of the few world leaders who really cares about the people&apos;s welfare.<br/><br/>Despite her resignation from office, I enjoyed reading Ms Ardern&apos;s autobiography. She&apos;s an optimist and a fighter, who made wondrous advances for her country (even if not always appreciated). She&apos;s also a gifted writer and born story teller, who invites us to share her life story. Her daughter Neve (rhymes with steve) comes alive in these pages and is adorably human. So, too, is her husband, as well as her parents, grandparents, and political colleagues. You will come to know and admire them all. No small accomplishment.<br/><br/>Bottom line: Jacinda Ardern is a humane voice from Down Under.<br/></span>   </div><div class=\"a-expander-header a-expander-partial-collapse-header\"><div class=\"a-expander-content-fade\"/><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" data-hook=\"expand-collapse-read-more-less\" aria-label=\"Read more of this review\" aria-expanded=\"false\" role=\"button\" data-action=\"a-expander-toggle\" class=\"a-declarative\" data-a-expander-toggle=\"{&quot;allowLinkDefault&quot;:true, &quot;expand_prompt&quot;:&quot;Read more&quot;, &quot;collapse_prompt&quot;:&quot;Read less&quot;}\"><i class=\"a-icon a-icon-extender-expand\"/><span class=\"a-expander-prompt\">Read more</span></a></div></div>",
