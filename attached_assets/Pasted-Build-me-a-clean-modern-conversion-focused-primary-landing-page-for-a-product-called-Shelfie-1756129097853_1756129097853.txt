Build me a clean, modern, conversion-focused **primary landing page** for a product called **Shelfie**. This is the single page leading into the application, so keep it focused, simple, and optimised for sign-ups.

## Core tagline
**Stop stacking. Start scanning.**

### Hero section
- Large bold headline with the tagline.  
- Subline: *Turn every book into a beautifully organised digital library in seconds. Barcode scanning, rich metadata, and stunning 3D shelves — effortless, private, and always yours.*  
- Bright orange CTA button: **Start scanning now →**  
- Trust line below CTA: *Free for up to 100 books · No credit card required*  
- Visual: mockup of a 3D bookshelf with **examples of real book covers** (e.g. popular titles like *Sapiens*, *Atomic Habits*, *Harry Potter*, etc.) rotating or displayed dynamically to show how a user’s library will look.  

### How it Works (3 steps)
1. **Scan** — Point your camera at a barcode. Works offline, syncs later. Example visual: scanning *The Midnight Library* or *Educated*.  
2. **Auto-enrich** — Instantly fetches metadata: title, author, edition, cover, dimensions. Example visual: metadata card for *Becoming* by Michelle Obama.  
3. **Enjoy** — Browse and share your library in stunning 3D. Example visual: a 3D shelf showing *The Hobbit*, *Pride & Prejudice*, *The Martian*.  

### Why People Love Shelfie (value props grid)
- **Lightning-fast capture** — Scan books instantly, even offline.  
- **Beautiful 3D shelves** — Books appear as they are: tall hardbacks, slim paperbacks, everything in between. Example: show side-by-side visual of *War and Peace* vs. *The Little Prince* to highlight proportionality.

- **Portable & private** — Your library, your rules. Export anytime.
