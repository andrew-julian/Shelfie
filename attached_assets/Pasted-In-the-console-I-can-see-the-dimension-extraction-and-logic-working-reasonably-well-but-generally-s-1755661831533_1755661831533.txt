In the console I can see the dimension extraction and logic working reasonably well, but generally speaking it is assigning the height to the width and the width to the height.

The only example where it's technically correct is Westography as that is a coffee table book, otherwise for all the other titles the height has been swaped with the width.

Lets not deal with the Westography exception for now, please tweak the logic so that in all the examples below you switch height and width.

Interestingly, these two titles do have the correct width and height...

1. The Elements of Pizza
2. First Knowledges Innovation
