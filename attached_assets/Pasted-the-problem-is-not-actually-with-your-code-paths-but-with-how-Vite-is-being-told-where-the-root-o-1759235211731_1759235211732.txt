the problem is not actually with your code paths, but with how Vite is being told where the ‚Äúroot‚Äù of your project is during the Vercel build.

What‚Äôs Happening

The error is:

[vite]: Rollup failed to resolve import "/src/main.tsx" from "/vercel/path0/client/index.html".


This tells us Vite/ Rollup thinks /src/main.tsx is an absolute path on the filesystem (inside /vercel/path0) instead of resolving it relative to your project root.

That happens when the root setting is missing (or wrong) in vite.config.ts.
Without it, Vite defaults to the repo root, which doesn‚Äôt line up with where your client/ code is.

Why It Broke

From your own notes in the fourth screenshot: you simplified the build script, but in doing so the root was dropped. That makes Vite resolve paths incorrectly on Vercel, even though it still works fine in Replit.

The Fix

You need to restore the correct root resolution in your vite.config.ts. Here‚Äôs what to do:

1. Open vite.config.ts

Make sure it contains:

import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";
import path from "path";

export default defineConfig({
  root: path.resolve(__dirname, "client"), // üëà This is crucial
  plugins: [react()],
  build: {
    outDir: path.resolve(__dirname, "dist"),
    emptyOutDir: true,
  },
});


That tells Vite:

root is client/ ‚Üí so /src/main.tsx resolves correctly.

build output still goes to dist/ (Vercel expects this).

2. Update package.json build script

Use the standard build command ‚Äî no custom hacks:

"scripts": {
  "dev": "vite",
  "build": "vite build && esbuild server/index.ts --platform=node --bundle --outfile=dist/server.js",
  "start": "node dist/server.js"
}

3. Verify index.html

Make sure your client/index.html is the only entry point and that it has:

<script type="module" src="/src/main.tsx"></script>


No duplicates elsewhere. If you created a stray index.html at repo root, delete it.

4. Clean Deploy

Run locally:

rm -rf dist .vercel .next
npm run build


Then deploy again to Vercel:

vercel --prod


‚úÖ Result:

Vite now treats /src/main.tsx relative to client/.

Rollup resolves imports correctly.

No more absolute path confusion on Vercel.

You‚Äôll finally get fresh production deployments again.
